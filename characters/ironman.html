        Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, is a genius billionaire, inventor,
        and philanthropist in the Marvel Universe. Created by Stan Lee, he first
        appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963. After suffering a
        life-threatening chest injury, Stark built a high-tech armored suit to
        save his life and escape captivity. Using his intelligence and vast
        resources, he continuously upgrades his suit with advanced weapons,
        flight capabilities, and artificial intelligence. As a founding member
        of the Avengers, Iron Man plays a crucial role in defending the world
        from powerful threats. His sharp wit, confidence, and sacrifice make him
        one of Marvelâ€™s most iconic superheroes.
